        Writing is becoming more and more of a thing designers do. For some of us, that‚Äôs good. We like writing, and it makes up for our other social and professional deficiencies. üòÖ
    </p>
    <p>
        For others, it might just not be their thing.
    </p>
    <p>
        I bet this second group is in the majority. And maybe that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre reading this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are five types of articles relevant for designers. If you‚Äôre trying to get into writing and feeling stuck, this may help you pin down an approach. Pick one and start sharing your wisdom with us.
    </p>
    <div id="title1" class="title">
        1. Opinion Pieces
    </div>
    <p>
        Here‚Äôs a stance‚Äîthe best designers are those that balance fierce opinions with confident humility.The old strong opinions loosely held maxim. The thing about opinions is you need them to design, and writing about them is an excellent way to jump into writing.
    </p>
    <div class="title-little">
    What
    </div>
    <p>
        Your thoughts, blood, and guts laid out on the notepad of life. Kidding, but really, these are insightful articles with a message. Maybe the message isn‚Äôt super practical, or maybe it is. It should make a clear point, preferably in not-too-many words. The key thing is it‚Äôs your opinion.
    </p>


    <div class="title-little">
        Why
    </div>
    <p>
        Writing about our opinions on design helps us to develop and articulate how we approach problems, and clarify what‚Äôs important to us. They help us find a voice, establish our own design principles, and help readers to figure out their own opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Plus there is such a low barrier to entry. A brain will do. Go write.
    </p>
    <div class="title-little">
        How
    </div>
    <p>
        The possibilities are endless, but best to start by observing everything and making meaning out of it all. The place you live, the people you interact with, the books you read, the movies you watch, the struggles you have, any success you achieve.
    </p>
    <p>
        The best opinion pieces speak from the heart and connect everyday things to our lives as designers (or, as people).
    </p>
    <div id="title2" class="title">
        2. Process & Best Practice
    </div>
    <p>
        Now we‚Äôre getting to more practical design writing.
    </p>
    <div class="title-little">
        What
    </div>
    <p>
        Process pieces help designers work better, whether that‚Äôs in formulating their design process, learning how they can fix small or big problems, and balance being ‚Äòheads down‚Äô and contributing to their company as a whole.
    </p>
    <div class="title-little">
        Why
    </div>
    <p>
        It‚Äôs helpful, and will make you a trusted resource for people struggling. Work is hard. People are weird. Dynamics at work can be good, or terrible, usually a bit of both. Figuring out the processes to work better will always be a valuable contribution.
    </p>
    <div class="title-little">
        How
    </div>
    <p>
        Be overly observant in you workplace. Writing about processes and improving the day-to-day work life of designers requires empathy with those around you. Talk to people, both those with ideas for how things should be, and those who are frustrated with the current state. Gather your thoughts, write, publish, repeat.
    </p>
    <div id="title3" class="title">
        3. Deep Dives & How To‚Äôs
    </div>
    <p>
        These articles are by far the most practical type, since they dig into the craft of design and the tools we all use. Writing them shows we know our stuff, and we have command of the craft.
    </p>
    <div class="title-little">
        What
    </div>
    <p>
        We‚Äôve always had tools, and we need to learn those tools to do our work. These pieces give us guidance and instruction to create things. Some simple, some complex. All very useful.
    </p>
    <div class="title-little">
        Why
    </div>
    <p>
        Two things. First, it shows we can deliver. Delivering is good. Second, it shows we can explain and teach others how to deliver. Those are two essential characteristics of any designer who hopes to earn a living doing design, and grow into a design leader.
    </p>
    <div class="title-little">
        Ideas
    </div>
    <p>
        Experiment with your tools, watch other designer videos and read their articles. Be a creator, and document your steps. Once you know your tool, you‚Äôll be able to share it.
    </p>
    <p>
        But tools are changing fast. Your piece might be outdated in a few months. Keep this in mind as you write, and decide whether you want to focus on specific features, or on the concepts behind the features.
    </p>
    <div id="title4" class="title">
        4. Unsolicited Redesigns & Teardowns
    </div>
    <p>
        Good for an empty portfolio, for fun, to learn, and for making enemies. Could even land you a job.
    </p>
    <div class="title-little">
        What
    </div>
    <p>
        These pieces are the ones where designers take someone else's product, analyze it, and in some cases redesign certain elements (or the whole damn thing). ‚ÄúHow I‚Äôd Redesign Gmail in an Hour‚Äù, or ‚ÄúWhy LinkedIn needs more Dark Patterns‚Äù. Feel free to steal those.
    </p>
    <div class="title-little">
        Why
    </div>
    <p>
        These pieces speak volumes (good and bad) to how you approach problems, and come up with solutions. They‚Äôre often shared a lot, so it can be a way to get some eyes on you as well. Careful though, they can work for or against you.
    </p>
    <div class="title-little">
        How
    </div>
    <p>
        Don‚Äôt be presumptuous, or inflate how great you think your redesign is. Design never happens in a vacuum, and designers always need to compromise. A lone designer, with little to no research, no team dynamics, a working coffee machine, and full control over the heat of their room. That‚Äôs not the real world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Be honest and humble, above all else. Give props where they‚Äôre due. Your article should flatter them, not piss them off. Be clear on why you‚Äôre writing it, and frame the approach accordingly.
    </p>
    <div id="title5" class="title">
        5. Product critique
    </div>
    <p>
        Critique is a funny thing. People are not known for giving helpful feedback on design. But it‚Äôs something that designers need to be good at. In my opinion, good digital product design critique is lacking.
    </p>
    <div class="title-little">
        What
    </div>
    <p>
        Similar to the teardowns above, but more conceptual. A critique is not necessarily redesigning anything, or touching an interface, though it can be. It should get to the heart of a product‚Äôs value proposition, or how it was executed.
    </p>
    <div class="title-little">
        Why
    </div>
    <p>
        Like teardowns and opinion pieces, it shows you have a mind. And, if done well, that you have the powers of critical thinking and analysis. These are all important qualities for designers, so showing you have them is a good thing.
    </p>
    <div class="title-little">
        How
    </div>
    <p>
        Designers tend to lean towards one of two critique styles ‚Äî tearing apart others‚Äô work (ie the MO of the internet) or giving pure praise (Dribbble). Try to approach critique with more nuance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like you‚Äôre critiquing the work of a friend you care about, and also want to succeed. Candid feedback is what he/she needs, but every product has good and bad, so make sure to be balanced.

    <p>We all know that design involves a codex of taste—evident to its practitioners yet largely unwritten. To explain this understanding a key would help; that is, a system of good and bad that resembles design yet states explicit rules. We can then attempt to ‘read’ design via this system and see how it fits. 
    </p>
    <p>I claim that writing might be useful, for there are actual principles of good writing—some of which are fixed on paper. While learning to write well I discovered that many of the principles attributed to good writing apply to design as well.

            Comparing language to a picture, one late-eighteenth-century grammarian defines nouns as forms, adjectives as colours, and the verb as the canvas itself, upon which the colours are visible. An invisible canvas, entirely overlaid by the brightness and design of the words, but one that provides language with the site on which to display its painting. — Michel Foucault, philosopher. The Order of Things, 1966

    <div id="title1" class="title">Draft, then polish</div>
    <p>Let’s begin with the sense of flow that is known to both designers and writers. At the beginning of a new project—be it a poster, website, or book—one need not be interrupted by polishing and petty work, trying to create something big all at once. For instance, a lot of writers recommend making no corrections until you are finishing, whether a poem or a chapter of a book.
    <br>
    Yet there’s more to writing and design than this. Essentially, there are two phases of both writing and designing: (1) draft and (2) polish. After the whole thing is roughly assembled in a flash of inspiration, you must take a break, change the pace, and refine the details.

                “Never send a letter or a memo on the day you write it. Read it aloud the next morning—and then edit it.” — David Ogilvy, founder of advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather. How to Write, 1982

    <div id="title2" class="title">Some details are important from the start</div>
     <p> Earlier I stated that, while drafting, one shouldn’t stop and get distracted by too many small details. Yet it’s also important to select certain details carefully from the beginning because the wrong choices can lead to a whole that’s dysfunctional and weak, which no amount of polishing can correct. 
        For a writer, these crucial details are usually certain words in key parts of the text. In design, these correspond to choosing the right typefaces. Good typefaces are generally thought to be the foundation of a good layout.

    <div id="title3" class="title">Stay true to the meaning</div>
    <p> 
        Why are words and typefaces so important? Because the very idea of both writing and design is based on the existence of something underneath that needs to be exclaimed. There’s a meaning to be told, and the process of writing or designing is only a way to exclaim this meaning. That’s why wrong choice is fatal: it makes the creation contradict its own meaning from the very start, and thus beyond repair. Everything should help to convey the meaning in the first place. All the decoration is of secondary importance.

        Concluding his rules for good writing in the essay Politics and the English Language, George Orwell states: 
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>
            “What is above all needed is to let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way about.”
        </i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Compare it with the principle “Form follows function,” associated with 20th century modernist architecture and industrial design, when the shape of a building or object should be based upon its intended function or purpose.
    </p>
    <div id="title4" class="title">Communicate</div>
    <p>
        Once we accept that there is a meaning to be told, it’s useful to more fully engage with the metaphor of communication. That is, in both writing and design there is not only a message but one who sends the message—as well as one that receives it. There’s thought to be a common code that both of them understand; and if they don’t, then the communication fails. That’s why both designer and writer must keep in mind who their “readers” are, and what “language” they speak.

            “A difficulty in imagining what it is like for someone else not to know something that you know,” writes Steven Pinker, cognitive psychologist and linguist in The Sense of Style, 2014. “The key is to assume that your readers are as intelligent and sophisticated as you are, but that they happen not to know something you know.”
        </i>
    </p>
    <p>
        ..The problem with the designs of most engineers is that they are too logical. We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish it to be.
...Consider the door. There is not much you can do to a door: you can open it or shut it. Suppose you are in an office building, walking down a corridor. You come to a door. In which direction does it open? Should you pull or push, on the left or the right? Maybe the door slides. If so, in which direction? I have seen doors that slide up into the ceiling. A door poses only two essential questions: In which direction does it move? On which side should one work it? The answers should be given by the design, without any need for words or symbols, certainly without any need for trial and error.”

            Much of the difficulty that we have with computers and related devices is due to poor interface design rather than to any complexity inherent to the task or to any lack of effort or intelligence on the part of users. — Jef Raskin, human–computer interface expert. The Humane Interface, 2000
        </i>
    </p>
    <div id="title5" class="title">Be clear</div>
    <p>
        The language metaphor opens a lot of pathways to follow. I’ll focus on clarity techniques. That is, both writer and designer need to be clear and lessen any potential confusion for their reader (or viewer). That’s where the analogy between writing and design becomes operational: there are explicit rules in writing to heighten clarity, which are applicable in design, too.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        There is also an ethical subtext to these rules, acknowledged by certain practitioners in the fields of writing and design. The gist of it is: that which doesn’t heighten clarity, fosters the potential for malice. 
    </p>
    <P>
        This is how George Orwell stated it in his 1946 essay Politics and the English Language: “A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions: What am I trying to say? Which words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly? But you are not obliged to go to all this trouble. You can shirk it by simply throwing your mind open and letting the ready-made phrases come crowding in. They will construct your sentences for you—even think your thoughts for you, to a certain extent, and they will perform the important service of partially concealing your meaning even from yourself. It is at this point that the special connection between politics and the debasement of language becomes clear.” 
Apply Orwell's words to design.
